The example file provided for you to get some hands-on experience while you follow along with the video 
includes an Access .mdb format database.

Extract the file from the zip archive and place it in a convenient location on your local hard drive.

as you will be required to enter the entire drive and folder path during the follow-along video – 
keeping this path short will make typing easier.
The video uses the location: C:\Data
